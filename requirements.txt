# Note: gevent can require native build dependencies on some hosts (libffi, gcc).
# To avoid build failures on Render, do not pin gevent here unless you have the
# corresponding OS-level build packages installed. If you want to use gevent in
# production, either install the system build deps in your Render build command
# (see DEPLOYMENT.md) or pin a prebuilt wheel version that is compatible with
# the Python runtime used by Render. For now we leave gevent out to ensure
# smooth deployment. Use `gthread` worker-class in Gunicorn instead.
